            <h1>What Cables and Connectors Are Used with PA Systems?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Various cables and connectors are used with PA systems to link all the equipment together. If the wrong cables or connectors are used, equipment may not operate correctly. In the worst-case, using the wrong cables or connectors could be dangerous, so be sure to understand which cables and connectors to use.</p>

            <h2>XLR</h2>

                <p>XLR cables are preferred to other types of cables because they have a very low signal to noise ratio.

                XLR cables are standardized equipment in the audio and recording industry and are used for a wide variety of devices. XLR cables can be used with speakers, mixers, amp, microphones, and other audio/recording gear.</p>

            <h2>Jack Cables(TRS/TS/TRRS)</h2>

                <p>There are several functions of the TRS cable, and it helps to connect stereo signals between devices and is also suitable for mono, balanced movements.

                    TRS cable serves in two ways. There is a single cable that conveys two audio signals, and there is also a ground signal. The two signs can be cold or hot, depending on how it connects to equipment. It is an unbalanced mono TRS cable connected to the correct audio and a stable one if combined with the left sound.</p>

                <p>TS cable is vital for mono unbalanced signals and is efficient in the connection of keyboards and guitars. They have two conductors, with insulation between them, and the apex conveys audio signals while the casing is a ground line.</p>

                <p>The plug became popular in the 1950s. The 3.5millimeter jack works harmoniously with one of the initial radios, Walkman. They require the jack to connect to an external speaker as they come without one. The 3.5mm jack allows proper conveyance of stereo audio sounds. Furthermore, it ensures call, volume, and playback on specific mobile devices and laptops.

            <h2>RCA</h2>

                <p>These connectors are generally used with audio and audio-visual (AV) equipment, and are solely for use with unbalanced signals. The connectors are colored according to the signal type. The white connector is used for sending signals to the left (L) channel, and the red connector is used for sending signals to the right (R) channel.</p>

            <h2>Speakon</h2>

                <img src="/pics/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg (1).jpg">
                <p>This is a dedicated connector equipped with a lock, used for professional equipment. It is used to connect power amplifiers and passive speakers. After inserting the cable, turn it clockwise to lock it.</p>

            <h2>Stripped Wire</h2>
            <hr>

                <img src="/pics/istockphoto-1257727879-612x612.jpg">
                <p>Stripped speaker cables are for general use, such as with home audio systems. They are usually color-coded to indicate the positive (+) and negative (-) wires. Connecting the wires in reverse will cause the phases to reverse, so be sure to connect the power amplifier and passive speakers so that their positive and negative sides match up.</p>
