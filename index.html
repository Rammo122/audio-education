            <h1>What Does A PA System Do?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>A PA system is an audio system that amplifies sound. It is used in a variety of settings, including live music venues, conference rooms, and educational facilities. A PA system typically comprises several components, including speakers, amplifiers, and a mixer.</p>
            <h1>What Are The Parts Of A PA System?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>There are several individual parts that make up a typical PA system. These parts include microphones, mixers, amplifiers, speakers, and cabling. Each part plays an important role in how the system works.
              PA systems in general have the same components, with more speakers and components being added depending on the application. 
              
              For example, a small conference room with one presenter will require just two speakers, an amplifier and a microphone. However, a PA system for a live band will require multiple speakers, a mixing desk with multiple inputs, multiple microphones, and on-stage monitors so that the musicians can hear themselves. 
              
              Here are the main parts of a PA system:</p>
            </div>
              <h2>1. Microphones</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>Microphones are used to capture sound waves and convert them into electrical signals.</p>
              <div class="mic">

              </div>
              <h2>2. Mixers</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>Mixers take the electrical signals from the microphones and combine them together. They also adjust the level of each signal so that they are all equalised.

                This is important when using PA for a band. For example, you will want to adjust the volume level of the mixer to ensure that the drums, guitars and vocalists can all be heard well without one particular instrument being too loud or too low. </p>

                <h2>3. Amplifiers</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>Amplifiers increase the strength of the signal so that it can be sent to the speakers. Whether you need an amplifier will depend on the type of speaker. 

                Some PA systems use active speakers. This means that the amplifier is built into the speaker itself and therefore it does not require an external amplifier.
                
                Some PA systems use passive speakers. This means that the speakers need an external amplifier to ensure that the signal is strong enough to be amplified. </p>

                <h2>4. Speaker</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>Speakers convert the electrical signal back into sound waves so people can hear them.</p>

              <h2>5. Cabling</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>Cabling connects all the different parts of the system together so that they can work as one unit.

                From my experience, getting good quality cabling with strong connections is a great investment, as good quality cabling will last longer and give a better overall quality of sound. 
                
                The above components are the main parts common to nearly all PA systems with some variation when it comes to amplifiers and mixers.
                
                If you are using PA for a large venue or live band, you may need some additional components, such as:</p>

                <h2>6. Monitors</h2>
              <hr>
              <p>On-stage monitors may be needed so that the band members can hear themselves. 
                As we always place PA speakers in front of the microphone to reduce the risk of feedback, band members cannot hear themselves clearly or even their other band members. On-stage monitors which face the band and not the audience can help with this. </p>
